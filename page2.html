    <h4>Stuff to do.</h4></div>
    <p>I would like to travel a bit. Iceland, England, Scotland. Maybe Asia, its a big place, I don't know where. </p>
    <p>As far as work goes, I would love to get involved in companies like Reddit, Twitch and/or Netflix. I think that would be fun to work in those environments. But work is work, so I would be super stoked to do anything.</p>
    <p>I would happily live in the Denver/Boulder Area, however, I love California, so SF Bay, San Diego and LA would defiantly be on the list of places I would happily live.</p>
